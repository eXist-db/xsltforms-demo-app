# XSLTForms Demo

This repository contains the examples that ship with [XSLTForms](http://www.agencexml.com/xsltforms), prepared for easy installation via the [eXist-db Package Manager](http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/public-repo/index.html). The examples were extracted from the XSLTForms 1.3 release (December 2018).

A companion application, [XSLTForms](https://github.com/eXist-db/xsltforms-xar), contains the core XSLTForms files and is also available from the eXist-db Package Manager.
